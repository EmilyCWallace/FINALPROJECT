  <h2>What is Petroleum Geology and How Does it Contribute to the Demand for Geologists.</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  </div>

        <p style="font-size:12pt;">Petroleum geology involves drilling underground to obtain oil and natural gas to produce hydrocarbon fuels. These hydrocarbons are found in reservoirs that are trapped between impermeable layers, typically shale. The impermeable layers bear a permeable layer, oftentimes shale, in between where the hydrocarbons are stored. This industry is known to be contoversial as overdrilling can lead to oil and gas spilling into the underwater reserve and contaminating ground water and soil. Since the industrial revolution, the demand for oil has been consistently high, which, of course leads to a high demand of petroleum geologists. Other geologists as well as some petroleum geologists are searching for more efficant ways to produce renewable forms of energy.</p>
