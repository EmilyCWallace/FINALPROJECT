    <h2>What is seismology and how does it contribute to the growing demand for geologists?</h2>
    <p>Seismologists study Earthquakes and the waves they produce to determine the intensisty. They can also study the tremors of volcanos that are pending eruption. They use a variety of tools, but the main one is a seismograph. This is essential a machine that reads the wave activity and prints it with a needle and paper. Seismologists are important for understanding where dangerous focal points lie and when disaster is near.</h3>
